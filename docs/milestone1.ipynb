    "We will be buidling a library that performs Automatic Differentiation (AD). Any client can install and use the library for personal or professional use and obtain an estimate of the value of the derivative (or gradient / Jacobian in higher dimension) of the function provided at the data point given as argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfroming fast differentiation and obtaining drivatives is absolutely necessary as it is a skill needed for a lot of real life applications. Indeed, most of systems modeling use differential equations to describe a behaviour and these equations require to take derivatives of sometimes complex function. Also, taking the gradient of a function at a given point and cancel it is the most effective way (at least analytically) to find the extrema of a function. Computing the values of extrema is a key feature to optimize a function and the processes it represents.\n",

    "Describe (briefly) the mathematical background and concepts as you see fit. You do not need to give a treatise on automatic differentiation or dual numbers. Just give the essential ideas (e.g. the chain rule, the graph structure of calculations, elementary functions, etc). Do not copy and paste any of the lecture notes. We will easily be able to tell if you did this as it does not show that you truly understand the problem at hand. \n",

    "### 1. Intro to AD\n",
    "\n",
    "AD is a way to obtain the value of the derivative of a function $f$ at a point $X$. The objective is to obtain a method providing more precise values than the naive estimators using Taylor expansion. Such estimators require fine tuning of parameters in order to give an approximation which is close enough to the truth value but which does not fail because of the floating point approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chain Rule is the key element of AD. Indeed we can decompose recursively a function $f$ into elementary components. For example, if we consider the function $f(x, y) = cos(x+y) \\times sin(x-y)$, we can write it $f(x,y) = f\\left(prod(cos(sum(x,y)), sin(difference(x, y))))\\right)$. Although unclear for a human eye, such a function is easier to derive by a machine using the chain rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you can compute the derivative of a function with respect to a variable by computing recursively the derivatives of each of the components and the derivative of the main function with respect to its components.\n",
